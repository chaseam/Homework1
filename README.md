# EEA
EEA is a program that calculates the gcd of two random 4096-bit intergers
using an implimented Extended Eculidean Algorithm
and the GMU gcd function. 

## Setup
This program has a reliance on gmp-6.1.2
and the folder of those files should be included in the same
folder you wish to run this program. 

## Usage 
This has no input arguments and once called as an excecutable
will generate the 2 4096-bit integers used to carry out the program.

## Output
The results of the program will be outputed to the stdout of your system
with information on both calculated gcd's the Bezout coefficents,
and the difference (if it exists) between the two gcd's.
